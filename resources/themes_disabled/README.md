This is a test folder used to test custom icons for the Klipper category which is currently disabled for the Beta. Using a new theme is the only way I've been able to get it working without adding it directly to program files. If anyone figures out a way to get Cura to simply read it from the plugin directory, let me know.

If you'd like to use it: Edit the primary plugin file, uncomment line 64 with the 'Klipper' icon name and comment out line 63 with the temp one. Then rename this folder to just "themes", removing "disabled". After that select one of 'Klipper-' themes that should now appear in preferences. They are simply clones of the Cura dark and light themes. Restart and the category icon should become the Klipper logo. I have only tested this in recent versions.
